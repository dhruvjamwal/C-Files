// A tree is either a node
or the  structure consisting of a node and a set of children trees.

// B Tree

// Usually, we store data on the tree nodes.
We define the label(n) of a node n as the data stored on the node.

The level/depth of a node n is 
level(n) =
    ( 0 if n is a root 
    level(n′) + 1′∈ parent(n)
